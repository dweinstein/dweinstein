## CTO at NowSecure, Developer, Early Adopter, Collaborator, and Entrepreneur

Hi there! I'm David Weinstein, a passionate developer, early adopter of cutting-edge technologies, and an avid collaborator in solving hard problems. I'm enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and always eager to explore new ventures. Let's get in touch and create something amazing together! 💡

### 🔧 My Current Projects & Contributions
* 🚀 As the CTO at [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/), I am dedicated to ensuring the delivery of secure and efficient mobile app security solutions.
* 💻 Although a significant portion of my work remains private, I've recently been contributing to the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) project, with a focus on enhancing and fixing the [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) client generation. In the past, I developed a [Node.js API client](https://github.com/dweinstein/node-google-play) for the Google Play Store to download APKs. I rewrote that client in Rust [here](https://github.com/dweinstein/rs-google-play), which was [forked by EFF](https://github.com/EFForg/rs-google-play).
* 📱 As an expert in mobile apps, reverse engineering, security, privacy, and technology teams, I love collaborating on challenging problems and projects.
* 🐳 I've been an early adopter of many technologies, including Docker and [wrote some articles](http://bitjudo.com/blog/2014/03/13/building-efficient-dockerfiles-node-dot-js/) on the subject.
* 🛠️ You'll often find me using tools like [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida), [Radare](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2), and working on projects involving iOS or Android, [mitmproxy](github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy), and more.
* 🧠 I'm currently exploring the potential of OpenAI ChatGPT in various applications and also toying around with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
