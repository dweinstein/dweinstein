## CTO, Researcher, Developer, Security, Privacy, AI, and product development enthusiast

Hi there! I'm David, a passionate developer, early adopter, and team builder. I'm enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and always eager to chat about solving hard problems.

### 🔧 Projects & Contributions
* 📱 At [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/), I work with the product management, development, engineering, and research teams to enable automated mobile app security and risk management solutions at scale.
* :tophat: Although a significant portion of my work is private, I enjoy contributing while hacking on hobby projects. I like quirky things like fixing things like [Glamorous Toolkit](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit), or fixing [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) client generation for the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) project. In the past, I developed a [Node.js API client](https://github.com/dweinstein/node-google-play) for the Google Play Store to download APKs. I rewrote that client in Rust [here](https://github.com/dweinstein/rs-google-play), which was [forked by EFF](https://github.com/EFForg/rs-google-play).
* 🚀 I particularly like working in areas leveraging a broad set of skills ranging from AI, APIs, mobile technologies, reverse engineering, security, privacy. I enjoy working with product and technology teams, collaborating on all sorts of challenging problems and projects within an enterprise B2B organization.
* 🛠️ Lately I use a lot of tools especially [Glamorous Toolkit](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit), [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida), [Radare](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2), and working on projects involving iOS or Android, [mitmproxy](github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy), and more.
* 🐳 I've been an early adopter of many new technologies and someone who likes to rediscover old technologies. Sometimes I like to document things I learn with blog posts, e.g., [some handy docker articles from 2014](http://bitjudo.com/blog/2014/03/13/building-efficient-dockerfiles-node-dot-js/), which was back in the early days when everyone was learning how best to use containerization with development projects.
* 🧠 Doing lots of things with AI, cybersecurity, development, and general or doing research within relevant domains I touch day-today.
