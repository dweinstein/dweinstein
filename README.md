## CTO (currently @NowSecure), Developer, Early Adopter, Collaborator, and Entrepreneur

Hi there! I'm David, a passionate developer, early adopter, and team builder. I'm enthusiastic about entrepreneurship and always eager to chat about solving hard problems.

### 🔧 My Current Projects & Contributions
* 📱 At [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/), I work with the product development, engineering, and mobile research teams to enable automated mobile app security solutions at scale
* :tophat: Although a significant portion of my work remains private, I enjoy contributing while hacking on hobby projects. Recently I experimented with the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) project, with a focus on enhancing and fixing the [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) client generation. In the past, I developed a [Node.js API client](https://github.com/dweinstein/node-google-play) for the Google Play Store to download APKs. I rewrote that client in Rust [here](https://github.com/dweinstein/rs-google-play), which was [forked by EFF](https://github.com/EFForg/rs-google-play).
* 🚀 As someone with a lot of experience with mobile technologies, reverse engineering, security, privacy, and technology teams, I love collaborating on all sorts of challenging problems and projects.
* 🛠️ You'll often find me using tools like [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida), [Radare](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2), and working on projects involving iOS or Android, [mitmproxy](github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy), and more.
* 🐳 I've been an early adopter of many technologies, including Docker and [some handy articles](http://bitjudo.com/blog/2014/03/13/building-efficient-dockerfiles-node-dot-js/) back in the early days.
* 🧠 Recently I was exploring the potential of OpenAI's ChatGPT in various applications and also toying around with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and GitHub CoPilot.
