### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on many things, e.g., recently I've been hacking on 🎯[openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) improvements/fixes for the [erlang](https://www.erlang.org) client generation.
  - You'll often find me writing code in TypeScript/JavaScript/Node.js, Rust, Erlang, Python, C/C++.
- Sometimes people ask me about startups, mobile apps, security, privacy, and technology teams.
- 🤝 I’m happy to collaborate on any hard problems.
- You'll often see me using [Frida](github.com/frida/frida), [Radare](github.com/radareorg/radare2) and working on things involving mobile  or Android
- I'm currently on a kick with ChatGPT/OpenAI
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
